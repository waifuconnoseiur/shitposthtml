        <h3>About me:</h3>
            <p>I am - <b>as you may or may not have noticed</b> - a conneiseur of waifus. An <b>advocate for 2D tits</b> if you will.
               The anime girls are always so much nicer than real life women. My theory is that the decline in quality of
               "fleshtubers" and "real" women, is responsible for the rise of Vtubers and porn addicts. This has accelerated
               the <b>demographic collapse of the west.</b> The solution I propose is simple: Fund the SpaceX program to make <b>catgirl robots</b>
               with functioning wombs, and cloned eggs. <b>Checkmate 3D bitches.</b></p>
            <em><strong>I have a dream,</strong> one day we shall no longer fear "real" women. <strong>My fellow weebs,</strong> I have a dream, that one day Monsanto
                shall use their <strong>powers for good</strong>. I have a dream, that one day the imminence of <strong>demographic collapse</strong> shall no longer
                haunt us. <strong>I have a dream, of a harem of breedable catgirls</strong></em>
            <p>-M.L.K., probably, if he were alive and a weeb</p>
